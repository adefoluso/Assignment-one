                On the frontend development side, I am a self-taught developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. Passionate about
                making the web accessible, I am dedicated to my work, enjoying every bit of converting and building web
                designs into end products. Creating attractive user interfaces for end-users is something I find deeply
                fulfilling.
